I was unable to get part3a to run correctly, but looking up the mprotect command here's what I've gathered:

The mprotect command turns off access protection for the specified area of memory. Without the mprotect command, the program attempts to access memory in a manner that is prohibited, causing the kernel to generate a segmentation error signal (SIGSEGV) and the program does not work.
